# Manifold Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: May 19th, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Manifold Markets, Inc ("**Manifold**" or "**we**", "**our**", or "**us**") is a social media platform that lets people discuss the future and trade on **play‑money prediction markets**. Because we ask users to share ideas, forecasts, and data, protecting your privacy is core to our mission.  This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, the choices you have, and the rights you can exercise.

By using Manifold—whether through our website, mobile apps, or any other services we provide (collectively, the "**Services**")—you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.

## 5. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK only)

If you are in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, we process your personal data on one or more of the following bases:

* **Contract** – as necessary to provide the Services you request (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).
* **Legitimate interests** – to keep our Services safe, improve them, and grow our business, provided those interests are not overridden by your rights (Article 6(1)(f)).
* **Consent** – for optional uses such as marketing emails or certain cookies (Article 6(1)(a)).  You can withdraw consent at any time.

## 6. How We Share Information

We may share information:

* **Publicly** – your username, avatar, predictions, market comments, and trades are visible to anyone unless you use a feature we label as private (e.g., direct messages).
* **Service providers & contractors** – companies that host data, send emails, provide analytics or security, and help us operate (bound by confidentiality and data‑protection obligations).
* **Advertising & marketing partners** – only if we decide to show ads; partners will not receive your private messages or password.
* **Compliance & safety** – to comply with laws, respond to legal process, protect our users, or defend our rights.
* **Business transfers** – in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of assets; we will notify you of changes.

We **never** sell your personal information for money.

We rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or other legal mechanisms to safeguard EU/UK data transfers.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If changes are material, we will provide prominent notice (e.g., via email or an in‑app banner) and, where required, obtain your consent.
